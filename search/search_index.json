My real name is Hoang Trung Nguyen, originally coming from Hanoi, Vietnam. My birth name originates from Huang Zhong, one of the Five Tiger Generals featured in the tales of Three Kingdoms. My dad and my older brother were really into that piece of literature at the time. My preferred name (Casper) comes from my Instagram story asking my friends for an English name that I can use in Canada (thank you Phuong Ha - she probably can't remember who I am at this point).</p> <p>I was born on September 25, 2002, into a family of four. My dad was a military officer, (retired as we speak) with the rank of colonel. He went to the Military Technology Academy (MTA) in Hanoi and held two degrees, one in computer engineering and one in missile engineering (what a chad). He started out working on Soviet-supplied air defense systems (which is why he used to speak Russian), then switched to military intelligence sometime later and spent the majority of his career there. He was the main reason that I have a passion for military stuff. My mom went to the Academy of Finance and works for the General Department of Taxation - Ministry of Finance (she is gonna retire soon). She had about a year of specialized education in France in the 2000s, and she also spoke French. My brother is 7 years older than me, and went to the Foreign Language Specialized School (CNN), where he studied Russian, and then to Foreign Trade University (FTU) for Bachelor of Internation Business Economics. He now works in advertisement. I am not really sure what exactly that he does, but he is well and good. He works in Ho Chi Minh City.</p> <p>And lastly, there is me! I, like my brother, also got into a highly selective high school in Hanoi - High School for Gifted Students, HNUE (CSP) - where I specialized in English. I think in my year the admission rate into English is about 1 in 27, and I was kind of at the bottom of the list. After 3 wonderful years of high school, I enrolled in the University of Alberta for Computing Science, and currently living in Canada.</p>"},{"location":"About%20Me/#my-hobbies","title":"My Hobbies","text":""},{"location":"About%20Me/#anime-and-manga","title":"Anime and Manga","text":"<p>This is probably what I spent most of my time on when I was in high school.

Throughout my first and second year, this question had not been on the back of my mind. Until one day, something clicked.</p> <p>It involves something called the pointer. You might have heard of it if you have used a low-level language like C. Basically, it is a variable that stores a memory address. The computer can then use that address and retrieve data.</p> <p>An array, as intuitive as it can be, is stored as consecutive segments of memory. Now, with that information, imagine yourself as the computer, what would you need to know to be able to work your way through an array?</p> <ol> <li>Is it an array? You cannot just assume that the computer knows what you are refering to is an array. You have to tell it.</li> <li>Where does the array start? It starts with a specific element, and the first byte that element has an address. This can be stored in a pointer!</li> <li>Where does the array end? It ends with an element, but instead of storing the address of that element, we add an element after that ending element. That final element is an end character, or <code>\\0</code>. If you wonder why can't we store the address of the ending element, please see CS_2 post.</li> <li>How big is each element? You have to tell the computer that this is an array of <code>int</code>, or <code>double</code>. Usually <code>int</code> is 4 bytes, <code>double</code> is 8.</li> </ol> <p>Let us look at the following example:</p> <pre><code>int c[] = {2, 1, 4, 5}; \n</code></pre> <p>We are explicitly tell the computer that:</p> <ul> <li> <p>This is an array (by using the syntax <code>c[]</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p>This is an array of <code>int</code>. All elements are 4 bytes each.</p> </li> <li> <p>We are using the pointer variable <code>c</code> to identify the starting address of the array!</p> </li> <li> <p>Although not shown, but the compiler secretely added a <code>\\0</code> character to mark the end. The actual array in memory is <code>{2, 1, 4, 5, \\0}</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>With such information, to traverse to whole array, we only need to leap 4 bytes many times, starting from the address stored in <code>c</code>, and ending when we reach the <code>\\0</code> character.</p> <p>Back to the main question, the index of an array starts from 0? Well, it shows the number of times that we have to leap, from the start, to reach the target element. In other words, it is the distance from the starting point. First element will be 0 element away from the start, isn't it?</p> <p>Can we just know how it works internally, and create a language where we index the first element as 1? Yes, absolutely. Prime examples are Pascal and Julia. However, the choice of indexing from 0 is more popular, and the only reason I could think of is that in the majority of cases it is better to look at things like a computer. Pascal on the other hand, is made to be simple, and Julia is made for mathemeticians who want to write code that looks as much like their research paper as possible, rather than programming.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/04/21/why-do-we-use-the-ending-character-0/","title":"Why do we use the ending character <code>/0</code>","text":"<p>In CS_1, we answered the question of why in most programming languages, the index of a list or an array starts from 0, not 1. However, one unanswered question was why do we have to use the <code>\\0</code> character to mark the end of the array, and not just caching the address of the actual last element?</p> <p>The reason lies in the bits and bytes. Basic information: a bit can be 0 or 1, and a byte is a group of 8 bits. Each byte in the computer memory will have a different address.</p> <p>Something like an <code>int</code> will take up 4 bytes, and the address of the first byte is the address of the <code>int</code> element. Imagine an <code>int</code> array like this:</p> <pre><code>{element_1, element_2, element_3, ... &lt;byte_1&gt;&lt;byte_2&gt;&lt;byte_3&gt;&lt;byte_4&gt;}\n</code></pre> <p>The address of the first element is the start of the array, yes, but the address of the last element is not the end of the array! It is, in fact, 3 bytes short. That is why the C compiler automatically add <code>\\0</code> at the end of the array, and identifies the array as the start to before the end character.</p> <p>By the way, if you ask why the C compiler knows where to add the end character, it is because you are forced to declare all elements or the number of elements in the array definition.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/08/another-layoff-at-blackberry/","title":"Another layoff at BlackBerry","text":"<p>Today, another layoff hit BlackBerry employees. I'm not sure if this wave is company-wide, or it is aimed specifically at employees under IVY division, working in Waterloo, Canada. Given the context of the tech job market in 2024 (or actually, also two or three years prior), a cost-cutting drive at BlackBerry should not come as a surprise. The shocking factor here is that my team got affected, earlier than anyone expected.</p> The BlackBerry C Building, Waterloo <p>BlackBerry IVY is an amazing idea, and I say that with the belief that it could become something like Node.js on cars. It has real potential. The problem is that it is still at its infancy, not even version 1.0 yet (version 0.96 as we speak). My team was responsible for the Development Experience (DX) of IVY, and our responsibilities are:</p> <ul> <li>Design, writing, and maintaining an accurate IVY Documentation. This includes the AWS side, which requires a lot of meetings back and forth.</li> <li>Design all images related to IVY, including those used in documentation, those used in sales events, and more.</li> <li>Organize end-to-end testing for every new wave of interns. This is to re-assess the DX of the product and the docs.</li> <li>We ourselves also try out IVY as we write the docs, and we act as last-line testers basically. A lot of the wordings in the <code>--help</code> menu would be really confusing without our work.</li> <li>Develop artifacts for the IVY Lab. This is not a high priority and mostly done by students, but I think it is worth noting. They can be used as example code to help the students (and maybe future full-time employees or customers) to understand IVY better. This is the only coding part, and I contributed a lot.</li> </ul> <p>All of those are not a lot of work, yes, and that is why we don't have a lot of people. It's all fine. Usually we have 1 Manager, 2 Senior Writers, 1 UI/UX, 2 Student Writers, and 1 Student Developer embedded in our team. Due to recent headcount reductions, 3 students are down to 1 (Student Writer - me), and we are not hiring students anymore. All good. But now they are dismantling the team completely. A outstanding manager who is very knowledgable and actually looks into all merge requests on Gitlab? Gone. A writer responsible for most API documentation and most of AWS part? Gone. The only designer in the whole IVY division? Gone! Like, what the heck? </p> <p>When I leave in August, it is expected that the only writer left is solely in charge of the docs, from what I can see right now. That is a lot of work, frankly a path to burnout for him. It also put more strains onto the developers, because without our manager's reviews, his work would be much more error-prone (not that he is not good, but anyone who write that much technical documnetation will make mistakes eventually). Developers on the other hand will waste much time review docs on behalf of our former manager, giving a maximum 80% quality, while having less time for coding.</p> <p>Our manager does a lot of management work, and honestly I don't know how that work would be carried on by other managers. They already had enough work to do with their own teams...</p> <p>And honestly don't know who is gonna take care of Figma now. The UI person case is, in my opinion, the dumbest layoff in this wave.</p> <p>The funny thing is, my manager's boss, is also going away. And our team works closely with a team that does Business Analytics and Customer Service. That team's manager is also gone. Keep in mind that all customer service work is done by 2 people. Actually, almost half of the IVY division is going away. Some teams only have one member left. Every dev teams lost at least one or two members. I heard that the dev teams in Ottawa lost like 14 people. Oh, and the HRs. Both HRs in charge of students when I came in are gone one or two weeks prior to this also. </p> <p>All of this, while expading the Bangalore office in India. Don't get me wrong, business in India is good, hiring in India, or anywhere, is fine by me. I just wish they didn't do that by closing 5 offices and hurting their employees in Canada and US.</p> <p>It is ironic that layoffs always happen on the most beautiful day ever, and at BlackBerry, it is always a Tuesday. As a writer, I see this as a metaphore of how the greed of capitalism can bring hell onto even the brightest days. It is also an awful way to treat your employees. I guess we are just numbers on some executive sheets. Among those who are laid off, my manager had 15 years at the company, and 3 others each has 20+ years. One was even with 30 years at the company, and his employee number was like, less than 40. They stuck with BlackBerry when the company lost its phone business. They helped the company through the toughest times. They are still great on their work. With everything they did, they get laid off with one email on Monday, saying Fridey is their last day. I guess all of that, and their families, does not matter anyways.</p> <p>My fellow writer told me that students are not real people, so they don't really get employee numbers and don't get important emails. Well, it seems to me that none of us are real people.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/15/the-terrible-customer-winbacks/","title":"The terrible customer winbacks","text":"<p>Recently, I switched my phone plan provider from Fido to Freedom.

I just kinda told them to stop calling me, it's like begging your ex to come back.</p> <p>Seriously, I think it is common sense that long time and existing customers should get the same or better offers than new comers.

Not even one item, and not the pricing of eny item either. Like heck, even A&amp;W has the famous root beer that got the whole country of Canada go crazy. If it is not for the lack of competition in the Canadian market, I think Harvey's wouldn't have been that big of a chain. It is a place that, if you are near by, and hungry, and you are like \"meh, whatever\", then you come in. Not bad, not good, nothing special.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#jollibee","title":"Jollibee","text":"<p>Jollibee, in my opinion, should be the standard of fastfood in Canada. It is the first big chain that I feel like the chain as a whole is worth your meal. I'm not even saying that the chain gives an incredible money value for your food or anything, but this is the standard. The main product is fried chicken, and although it has enough spices, enough crispiness, and the portion is big enough for the price. Wanna buy a chicken bucket? Buy at Jollibee. I don't care about the dip because I never dip my chicken, so no comments on that.</p> <p>I heard that there are also other products like spaghetti, but I never checked for that. If the menu is diversed, it would also be a huge plus.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#kfc","title":"KFC","text":"<p>KFC was my favourite in Vietnam, so subsequenty it was the most awaited experience for me when I came to Canada. I swear it felt very disappointing. </p> <p>I think I ordered it the first time in a mall in Edmonton, and the chicken drumstick was not only wimpy, but it was also of realy dark and dirty color, like it had been fried in crude oil or something. There was very little meat. The breading was wimpy but the chicken was dry. I don't know how they can do that.</p> <p>The next time was an Uber order in Vancouver. It looked cleaner, less dry, but still with the wimpy breading. It did not save my impression for the brand, but my mom liked it somehow.</p> <p>The last time was in Toronto, at a food court. This time was the most impressive. Breading was crispy, the chicken was moist, seasoning was enough. It still doesn't look appetizing though, definitely of darker color than most other franchises.</p> <p>Overall, I think KFC in North America is not good. The menu is very limited and nothing was really new. The pricing is fine, but I'm not quite sure if it is a good value for the food. I mean, the food quality, at best, is a hit or miss, and even that is also a sign of the crappy quality control across KFC branches. After some digging, it seems like KFC in NA has been in this spiral downwards for a decade or two. On the other hand KFC in other places (like Japan) is very popular for their quality and creative menu, so my advice is try KFC, but not in NA.</p> <p>Update: I gave it one more chance in Waterloo. The protion was enormous, but chicken was dry, seasoning was okay, and the fries were wimpy. Again, KFC in NA is a hit or miss.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#mary-browns-chicken","title":"Mary Brown's Chicken","text":"<p>I have never heard of the chain until I set foot in Waterloo, so I have no expectation. It seemed to have a bigger focus on the chicken burger than other chicken chains like KFC or Popeyes, and it was having a buy one get one promotion, so that was what I ordered. The quality was top notch. It felt really full, with a juicy piece of chicken that was adequately seasoned. The best part was the piece of pickle - it was placed on the side instead of in the hamburger! This gave the customer the freedom to either have it or not, because many people (including myself) really hate the pickle. This small gesture left a really good impression.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#mcdonalds","title":"McDonald's","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#new-york-fries","title":"New York Fries","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#panda-express","title":"Panda Express","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#papa-johns","title":"Papa John's","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#pizza-hut","title":"Pizza Hut","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#pizza-73","title":"Pizza 73","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#popeyes-louisiana-kitchen","title":"Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#subway","title":"Subway","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#taco-bell","title":"Taco Bell","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#thai-express","title":"Thai Express","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#tim-hortons","title":"Tim Hortons","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/reviewing-all-fastfood-chains-in-canada/#wendys","title":"Wendy's","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/life/","title":"Life","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/computer-science/","title":"Computer Science","text":""}]}
