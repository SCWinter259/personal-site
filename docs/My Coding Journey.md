# My Coding Journey

## 2018

My first semester of 11th grade was my first exposure to programming. For some reason, my informatics teacher at the time decided that my class should learn C++. It did not turn out well, because non of us really cared. We were an English specialised class, and also the Vietnamese high school system really does not place a heavy emphasis on programming (if any).

She realised that we sucked and switched to teaching Microsoft Excel the next semester. Unofficially, I used C++ and Codeblocks.

## 2020 | :simple-python:

September 2020 (Fall), I spent my first semester at the University of ALberta, majoring in Computing Science. I knew basically nothing but printing "hello world" in C++, which I had already forgotten. CMPUT 174 taught me **Python** programming on Wing IDE. I seriously don't understand the IDE choice. Interestingly, we were taught to make simple games with Pygame. It was pretty hard for me, but now I think if I can just have a bit more experience at the time, it would have been very enjoyable.

## 2021 | :simple-visualstudiocode: :simple-github: :simple-ubuntu: :simple-c: :simple-vim:

Winter 2021 semester, CMPUT 175 was still teaching my Python. However, I spent some time messing around, and for the first time had set up **Visual Studio Code** as my main text editor! I am still using it today, much more customized than before of course.

Spring and Summer of 2021, I messed around even more. Compared to other students, I was pretty early setting up my **Github** (many at my school does not do this till like thrid year). I did not know how to use Git though. 

Around this time, my very vintage laptop at the time was getting slow. It took like 3-5 minutes to start up. I did what I think was the most daring thing I did at the time: I dual booted my laptop with **Ubuntu**! Would say I was more daring than many CS students in 3rd or even 4th year.

Fall 2021 - my first year actually studying in Canada (I was online in Vietnam for the whole first year because of COVID-19) - CMPUT 201 gave me an introduction to **C**. The class was cruely hard, but introduced me to a lot of "deeper" technologies like **PuTTY** (for ssh access into school computer), **GCC**, **Makefile**, **Valgrind**, and **Vim**.

I also first tried out HTML and CSS around Christmas. It really went no where though.

## 2022 | :simple-sqlite: :simple-mongodb: :material-code-json: :simple-git: :simple-androidstudio: :material-language-java: :simple-markdown: :simple-gnubash: :simple-android: :simple-mui: :simple-firebase: :simple-androidstudio: :simple-junit5: :simple-githubactions: :simple-julia: :simple-pycharm:

Winter 2022, I took my CMPUT 291 and CMPUT 301. CMPUT 291 was about databases - we learned SQL, and together with Python, made a CLI-based app that query data from a **SQLite** database. Later in the course we also learned **MongoDB** and **JSON**. CMPUT 301 made us build an Android App with Java and Firebase, with full documentation, testing, diagrams,... Unfortunately, I was not ready for software engineering learning pace. I could barely code in this class. The only thing I learned is how to use **Git**, **Android Studio**, and some more advanced features of Github.

That summer, I decided to revise my **Java**, **Markdown**, and Git knowledge. I also precticed writing **Bash** scripts so that I can automate my Git process.

Fall 2022, I retook CMPUT 301. This time I can confidently say that I can develop an **Android** app with Java using Android Studio, **MaterialUI** and **Firebase**. I can write unit tests with **JUnit**, and intent test with **Espresso**. I can write documentation with Markdown, control all group work via Github Project Board, and setting up **Github Actions** for **Android CI**. I also took CMPUT 267, which is Basics of Machine Learning. It was mostly math and I hated that class. I used **Julia**, but hated the language too.

I also took CMPUT 261 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and slightly touched PyTorch. I won't consider myself as knowing how to use it though. One thing I did use quite okay was **PyCharm**.

## 2023 | :simple-riscv: :simple-html5: :simple-css3: :simple-jupyter: :simple-javascript: :simple-react: :simple-nodedotjs: :simple-express: :simple-redux: :simple-axios: :simple-nodemon: :simple-mongoose: :simple-pm2: :simple-dotenv: :simple-typescript: :simple-vercel: :simple-heroku: :simple-streamlit: :simple-django: :simple-bootstrap: :simple-semanticui: :simple-materialformkdocs: :simple-selenium: :simple-apache: :simple-swagger: :simple-trello: :simple-ios: :simple-macos: :simple-xcode: :simple-homebrew: :simple-expo: :simple-cocoapods: :simple-zsh:

Winter 2023, I took CMPUT 229, which gave my a first touch on assembly, particularly **RISC-V**. I also decided to back out from machine learning, at least in university, because I saw the amount of math as unbearable.

Summer of 2023, I started learning web development, seeing it as essential. I revised **HTML** and **CSS** (I still have to Google a lot when I write them), and also touched C#, Blazor, and ASP.NET. I would not consider myself as knowing them because I never used them to build anything.

I did not know what pushed me, but I also tried to learn numpy, pandas, R, and so on. All the tech for data analysis. That went no where are I wasted a lot of time. The only thing I could do was using **Jupyter Notebook**.

With the help of a friend-mentor, I learned **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node**, **Express** to complete the MERN stack. I also learned popular supporting tools, including **Redux**, **Axios**, **Nodemon**, **Mongoose**, **PM2**, **dotenv**, and most notably **TypeScript**. For hosting, I learned how to use **Vercel** and **Heroku**. With all these new technologies, and a tutorial on Youtube, I build my most wonderful website yet.

I also finished my long-running CMPUT 291 project with the help of the **Streamlit** framework.

Going on to Fall 2023, CMPUT 401 assigned me to work with Imagine Cities, a non-profit based in Calgary. Their project used **Django** for both frontend and backend. Along the way, I also learned **Bootstrap**, and a similar library called **SemanticUI**. I also learned to use Cybera for running CI/CD, which is an Alberta service similar to AWS's EC2 (I literally used EC2 tutorial for Cybera), **MKDocs** for documentation, and **Selenium** for testing. This class also had an assignment where I had to build an API. Most people used Django, but I used Node, then picked up **Apache** and **Swagger**.

As a good ending note for 2023, I also landed my first internship with Amelia. It was unpaid, but I learned React Native, **Trello**, and all the pain of **iOS** development (i.e. the whole Apple toolchain support for older Macbooks). That includes old **MacOS**, old **XCode**, old **Homebrew**, old **Expo**, and worst of all, old **cocoapods**. I also used **zsh**, of course.

## 2024 | :simple-confluence: :simple-jira: :simple-okta: :simple-gitlab: :simple-dart: :simple-flutter:

Starting 2024, I was lucky to have landed an internship with BlackBerry, this time as a Technical Writer Student. I was introduced to some more "corporate" tech products, including **Confluence**, **Jira**, and **Okta**. It was the first time I used **Gitlab** (it was unsurprisingly similar to Github).

I worked for the IVY team, and I used C++ quite frequently. I worked on a kind of private framework called IVY to make data connectors for car sensors, on top of the QNX operating system.

At home, I was self-studying **Dart** and **Flutter**, as well as making this website.

That's my journey until now. I'll update whenever I can.
