# My Coding Journey

## 2018

My first semester of 11th grade was my first exposure to programming. For some reason, my informatics teacher at the time decided that my class should learn C++. It did not turn out well, because non of us really cared. We were an English specialised class, and also the Vietnamese high school system really does not place a heavy emphasis on programming (if any).

She realised that we sucked and switched to teaching Microsoft Excel the next semester. Unofficially, I used C++ and Codeblocks.

## 2020 - :simple-python:

September 2020 (Fall), I spent my first semester at the University of ALberta, majoring in Computing Science. I knew basically nothing but printing "hello world" in C++, which I had already forgotten. CMPUT 174 taught me **Python** programming on Wing IDE. I seriously don't understand the IDE choice. Interestingly, we were taught to make simple games with Pygame. It was pretty hard for me, but now I think if I can just have a bit more experience at the time, it would have been very enjoyable.

## 2021 - :simple-visualstudiocode: | :simple-github: | :simple-ubuntu: | :simple-c: | :simple-vim:

Winter 2021 semester, CMPUT 175 was still teaching my Python. However, I spent some time messing around, and for the first time had set up **Visual Studio Code** as my main text editor! I am still using it today, much more customized than before of course.

Spring and Summer of 2021, I messed around even more. Compared to other students, I was pretty early setting up my **Github** (many at my school does not do this till like thrid year). I did not know how to use Git though. 

Around this time, my very vintage laptop at the time was getting slow. It took like 3-5 minutes to start up. I did what I think was the most daring thing I did at the time: I dual booted my laptop with **Ubuntu**! Would say I was more daring than many CS students in 3rd or even 4th year.

Fall 2021 - my first year actually studying in Canada (I was online in Vietnam for the whole first year because of COVID-19) - CMPUT 201 gave me an introduction to **C**. The class was cruely hard, but introduced me to a lot of "deeper" technologies like **PuTTY** (for ssh access into school computer), **GCC**, **Makefile**, **Valgrind**, and **Vim**.

I also first tried out HTML and CSS around Christmas. It really went no where though.

## 2022 - :simple-sqlite: | :simple-mongodb: | :material-code-json: | :simple-git: | :simple-androidstudio: | :material-language-java: | :simple-markdown: | :simple-gnubash: | :simple-android: | :simple-mui: | :simple-firebase: | :simple-androidstudio: | :simple-junit5: | :simple-githubactions: | :simple-julia:

Winter 2022, I took my CMPUT 291 and CMPUT 301. CMPUT 291 was about databases - we learned SQL, and together with Python, made a CLI-based app that query data from a **SQLite** database. Later in the course we also learned **MongoDB** and **JSON**. CMPUT 301 made us build an Android App with Java and Firebase, with full documentation, testing, diagrams,... Unfortunately, I was not ready for software engineering learning pace. I could barely code in this class. The only thing I learned is how to use **Git**, **Android Studio**, and some more advanced features of Github.

That summer, I decided to revise my **Java**, **Markdown**, and Git knowledge. I also precticed writing **Bash** scripts so that I can automate my Git process.

Fall 2022, I retook CMPUT 301. This time I can confidently say that I can develop an **Android** app with Java using Android Studio, **MaterialUI** and **Firebase**. I can write unit tests with **JUnit**, and intent test with **Espresso**. I can write documentation with Markdown, control all group work via Github Project Board, and setting up **Github Actions** for **Android CI**. I also took CMPUT 267, which is Basics of Machine Learning. It was mostly math and I hated that class. I used **Julia**, but hated the language too.
