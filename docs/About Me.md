# About Me

## My Background

My name is **Casper Nguyen**, but that is actually my preferred name. My real name is **Hoang Trung Nguyen**, originally coming from Hanoi, Vietnam. My birth name originates from [Huang Zhong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_Zhong), one of the Five Tiger Generals featured in the tales of [Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms). My dad and my older brother were really into that piece of literature at the time. My preferred name (Casper) comes from my Instagram story asking my friends for an English name that I can use in Canada (thank you Phuong Ha - she probably can't remember who I am at this point).

I was born on September 25, 2002, into a family of four. My dad was a military officer, (retired as we speak) with the rank of colonel. He went to the [Military Technology Academy (MTA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Quy_Don_Technical_University) in Hanoi and held two degrees, one in computer engineering and one in missile engineering (what a chad). He started out working on Soviet-supplied air defense systems (which is why he used to speak Russian), then switched to military intelligence sometime later and spent the majority of his career there. He was the main reason that I have a passion for military stuff. My mom went to the Academy of Finance and works for the General Department of Taxation - Ministry of Finance (she is gonna retire soon). She had about a year of specialized education in France in the 2000s, and she also spoke French. My brother is 7 years older than me, and went to the [Foreign Language Specialized School (CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Language_Specialized_School), where he studied Russian, and then to [Foreign Trade University (FTU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Trade_University) for Bachelor of Internation Business Economics. He now works in advertisement. I am not really sure what exactly that he does, but he is well and good. He works in Ho Chi Minh City.

And lastly, there is me! I, like my brother, also got into a highly selective high school in Hanoi - [High School for Gifted Students, HNUE (CSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_for_Gifted_Students,_Hanoi_National_University_of_Education) - where I specialized in English. I think in my year the admission rate into English is about 1 in 27, and I was kind of at the bottom of the list. After 3 wonderful years of high school, I enrolled in the [University of Alberta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alberta) for Computing Science, and currently living in Canada.
