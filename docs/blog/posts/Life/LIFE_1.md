# Another layoff at BlackBerry

Today, another layoff hit BlackBerry employees. I'm not sure if this wave is company-wide, or it is aimed specifically at employees under IVY division, working in Waterloo, Canada. Given the context of the tech job market in 2024 (or actually, also two or three years prior), a cost-cutting drive at BlackBerry should not come as a surprise. The shocking factor here is that my team got affected, earlier than anyone expected.

BlackBerry IVY is an amazing idea, and I say that with the belief that it could become something like Node.js on cars. It has real potential. The problem is that it is still at its infancy, not even version 1.0 yet (version 0.96 as we speak). My team was responsible for the Development Experience (DX) of IVY, and our responsibilities are:

- Design, writing, and maintaining an accurate IVY Documentation. This includes the AWS side, which requires a lot of meetings back and forth.
- Design all images related to IVY, including those used in documentation, those used in sales events, and more.
- Organize end-to-end testing for every new wave of interns. This is to re-assess the DX of the product and the docs.
- We ourselves also try out IVY as we write the docs, and we act as last-line testers basically. A lot of the wordings in the `--help` menu would be really confusing without our work.
- Develop artifacts for the IVY Lab. This is not a high priority and mostly done by students, but I think it is worth noting. They can be used as example code to help the students (and maybe future full-time employees or customers) to understand IVY better. This is the only coding part, and I contributed a lot.

All of those are not a lot of work, yes, and that is why we don't have a lot of people. It's all fine. Usually we have 1 Manager, 2 Senior Writers, 1 UI/UX, 2 Student Writers, and 1 Student Developer embedded in our team. Due to recent headcount reductions, 3 students are down to 1 (Student Writer - me), and we are not hiring students anymore. All good. But now they are dismantling the team completely. A outstanding manager who is very knowledgable and actually looks into all merge requests on Gitlab? Gone. A writer responsible for most API documentation and most of AWS part? Gone. The only designer in the whole IVY division? Gone! Like, what the heck? 

When I leave in August, it is expected that the only writer left is solely in charge of the docs, from what I can see right now. That is a lot of work, frankly a path to burnout for him. It also put more strains onto the developers, because without our manager's reviews, his work would be much more error-prone (not that he is not good, but anyone who write that much technical documnetation will make mistakes eventually). Developers on the other hand will waste much time review docs on behalf of our former manager, giving a maximum 80% quality, while having less time for coding.

Our manager does a lot of management work, and honestly I don't know how that work would be carried on by other managers. They already had enough work to do with their own teams...

And honestly don't know who is gonna take care of Figma now. The UI person case is, in my opinion, the dumbest layoff in this wave.

The funny thing is, my manager's boss, is also going away. And our team works closely with a team that does Business Analytics and Customer Service. That team's manager is also gone. Keep in mind that all customer service work is done by 2 people. Actually, almost half of the IVY division is going away. Some teams only have one member left. Every dev teams lost at least one or two members. I heard that the dev teams in Ottawa lost like 14 people. Oh, and the HRs. Both HRs in charge of students when I came in are gone one or two weeks prior to this also. 

All of this, while expading the Bangalore office in India. Don't get me wrong, business in India is good, hiring in India, or anywhere, is fine by me. I just wish they didn't do that by closing 5 offices and hurting their employees in Canada and US.

It is ironic that layoffs always happen on the most beautiful day ever, and at BlackBerry, it is always a Tuesday. As a writer, I see this as a metaphore of how the greed of capitalism can bring hell onto even the brightest days. It is also an awful way to treat your employees. I guess we are just numbers on some executive sheets. Among those who are laid off, my manager had 15 years at the company, and 3 others each has 20+ years. One was even with 30 years at the company, and his employee number was like, less than 40. They stuck with BlackBerry when the company lost its phone business. They helped the company through the toughest times. They are still great on their work. With everything they did, they get laid off with one email on Monday, saying Fridey is their last day. I guess all of that, and their families, does not matter anyways.

My fellow writer told me that students are not real people, so they don't really get employee numbers and don't get important emails. Well, it seems to me that none of us are real people.
