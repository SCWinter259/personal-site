# Reviewing all fastfood chains in Canada

My mom used to praised fastfood chains in the US, especially McDonald's, so much that their Vietnamese branches look like mere low-level clones. Now, I have not been to the US, but since I lowkey consider Canada the 51st state, I still made it the first doom quest to try out all fastfood chains in Canada.

## A&W

The first thing I noticed when I came to A&W is an incredibly short menu, and this seems to be consistent at every location that I have been to. It mostly offers 3 things: burgers, fries, and drinks. 

I usually order 2 **buddy burgers** for a random lunch, because they are incredibly cheap for quite a full meal. The buddy burger is just simply a beef burger piece and 2 buns - that bare bone and nothing more. However 2 of them for like $6-7 can be considered a good deal. If you are thinking about spending more than $10 for their bigger burgers, I think you are better off spending $15-17 at a local restaurant for a bigger, better burger, and a fries portion.

The most notable thing about this burger chain is, ironically, its drink - the **root beer** in particular. The A&W root beer is so good that it dominates the root beer market *outside* of the restaurant, and I think you might want to check it out.

## Booster Juice

Booster Juice was the first chain in this list that I had the chance to try in Canada. Ironically, I did not know it was a fastfood chain (it should have seemed obvious enough though), and did not intend to try it out. August 19, 2021, I landed at Vancouver Airport, and really needed something to drink through lunch. I wanted to choose something interesting because I had 6 hours of transit and do nothing.

I did not remember what I ordered, but it was bad. Maybe it was just my taste. It was too much sour, a fruit drink that felt like raw fruit juice. Maybe many people like it, I don't know. In Vietnam, we have far better options at much cheaper prices. They may have a bit of sugar, but somehow still feel more natural than Booster Juice. I never went to Booster Juice again, at least up until I write this line, which is more than 3 years later.
