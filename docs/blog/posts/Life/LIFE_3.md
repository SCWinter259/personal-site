# Reviewing all fastfood chains in Canada

My mom used to praised fastfood chains in the US, especially McDonald's, so much that their Vietnamese branches look like mere low-level clones. Now, I have not been to the US, but since I lowkey consider Canada the 51st state, I still made it the first doom quest to try out all fastfood chains in Canada.

## A&W

The first thing I noticed when I came to A&W is an incredibly short menu, and this seems to be consistent at every location that I have been to. It mostly offers 3 things: burgers, fries, and drinks. 

I usually order 2 **buddy burgers** for a random lunch, because they are incredibly cheap for quite a full meal. The buddy burger is just simply a beef burger piece and 2 buns - that bare bone and nothing more. However 2 of them for like $6-7 can be considered a good deal. If you are thinking about spending more than $10 for their bigger burgers, I think you are better off spending $15-17 at a local restaurant for a bigger, better burger, and a fries portion.

The most notable thing about this burger chain is, ironically, its drink - the **root beer** in particular. The A&W root beer is so good that it dominates the root beer market *outside* of the restaurant, and I think you might want to check it out.
