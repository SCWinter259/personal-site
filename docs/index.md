# Welcome to The Casper Show

Hi,

My name is Casper Nguyen, and I am a Computing Science student at the University of Alberta. For a more formal introduction, probably you should visit my Github, or take a look at my resume, or my portfolio website (if you are seeing this note than probably I have not finished it yet). This website is basically my personal blog, where I note down interesting things I came across in my life.

Why did I choose MKDocs for this? Why do I have to write stuff and host it? Is what I do here a waste of time? Well, I don't think everything I do with tech has to be for jobs. This website is basically a project that a build and host for fun. I'm not just an engineer. I am a human too.
